# under-may-tale-game
I made this game for a school project in which I had to program a game using python.
To control your character you have to move the mouse in the Main-Phases and in the Interacting-Phases you have to select an option with the arrow keys and select it with the Space-Bar

Also this is my first made program, so it's not that advanced

IMPORTANT: it only works with the program TigerJython, because of build in libraries
